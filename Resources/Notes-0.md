# Introduction to Natural Language Processing
[!WARNING]
The following notes assume basic programming skills (python) and mathematical skills (multivariable calculus and linear algebra).

Natural language processing (NLP) is an interdiciplinary subfield of artificial intelligence and linguistics. Natural languages (or ordinary languages) are languages that have evolved naturally through human use. NLP primarily concerns the ability for computers to process information that is encoded into natural languages. 

### Some low level tasks of NLP include the following: 
+ tokenization
+ morphological analysis
+ syntactic analysis
+ semantic analysis
+ discourse analysis

### Some high level tasks of NLP include the following[^1]:
+ text classification/generation/summarization/simplification
+ sentiment analysis
+ information retrieval
+ machine translation
+ text-to-speech/text-to-image/text-to-video
